# 🧠 AI Text Summarizer

**AI Text Summarizer** is a simple and powerful web app that uses state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically generate concise summaries from lengthy articles, documents, or reports. Built with Python, Streamlit, and Hugging Face Transformers, this tool helps save time and improve reading efficiency by distilling essential information into short, meaningful summaries.

## 💻 Platform & Editor

This project was developed on a **Windows 10** machine using:

- **Visual Studio Code** as the primary code editor
- **Anaconda (Python 3.10)** for managing packages and environments
- **Streamlit** for creating and running the interactive app locally

---

## 🧹 Application Use-Cases

- **Students** can quickly summarize textbooks or long-form notes
- **Researchers** can get quick insights from scientific articles or reports
- **Journalists** can extract summaries from news sources or blogs
- **Businesses** can summarize emails, meeting transcripts, or documents
- **Everyone** who deals with a large volume of text regularly!

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters or pastes long-form text into the input area.
2. The app uses Hugging Face’s `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model (an abstractive transformer-based model) to process and understand the text.
3. A concise summary is generated and displayed in a matter of seconds.
4. The user can adjust the summary length with the provided sliders.
