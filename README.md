## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters or pastes long-form text into the input area.
2. The app uses Hugging Face’s `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model (an abstractive transformer-based model) to process and understand the text.
3. A concise summary is generated and displayed in a matter of seconds.
4. The user can adjust the summary length with the provided sliders.
